# drone-DIY
Μια ομάδα μαθητών μου τόνισε ότι σοβαρή θέση στην εκμάθηση νέων τεχνολογιών πρέπει να έχουν εφαρμογές που ΔΙΑΣΚΕΔΑΖΟΥΝ όπως ένα drone-quadcopter
ΥΛΙΚΑ :
Motors -  the cheapest one, that works easily for this kind of drone 4 of them buy here: Gearbest
ESC's - depends on motors that you choose max current of ESC should be a little bit bigger than max current of motor. It must have BEC because flight controller is powered by it. We will also 4 of them. buy here: Gearbest
Battery - 3S (11.1V) Li-Po should be around 3000mAh to get 15 mins of flight time. Make sure that it can deliver enough current. buy here Gearbest
Frame - at the beggining it was 3D printed and in the feature it will be, but for now I used very popular F450 frame buy here: Gearbest
LiPo charger - you must charge lipo batteries with special charger with balancer. Remember to choose right power plug Gearbest
Propellers - can be different but this one works the best. I advise you to buy some more, they are easy to broke. They need to have a hole not thread. You choose some other color if you want. Gearbest
Battery protection/monitor - never connect battery to anything without it, I destroyed 2 Lipo's because I forgot about it. Gearbest
And here are parts for flight controller:

Atmega328 - I advise you to buy it in local shop
NRF24L01 - radio modul, we need it to create radio communication, remember to buy version with external antena because it has much bigger range Gearbest
MPU6050 - gyroscope and accelerometer in one module Gearbest
Some smaller parts:
capacitors 22pF (x2)
capacitor 10uF
resistor 4,7kOhm
3,3V linear stabilizer
some goldpins (female and male)
